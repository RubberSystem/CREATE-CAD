Debugging native code (debugging the OpenCascade code used by NaroCAD)

1. Debugging with WinDbg:

a. Debugging preparation:
  - Compile OpenCascade and Wrappers in debug mode. Please check that the Wrappers point to the debug version of OpenCascade modules when compiling and linking,
  - Configure WinDbg for debugging:
      Symbol file path example configuration:
      C:\OpenCASCADE6.3.0\ros\win32\bind;
      D:\work\sources_narocad\trunk\wrappers\builds\debug;
      D:\work\sources_narocad\trunk\trunk\narocad\bin\Debug
      
      Source file path example configuration:
      C:\OpenCASCADE6.3.0\ros\src;C:\OpenCASCADE6.3.0\ros\inc

b. Debug checks:
- If you want to debug the debug version of OpenCascade please check that the PATH and OpenCascade envirnoment variables point to the debug version of libraries.
Ex: from PATH: C:\OpenCASCADE6.3.0\ros\win32\bind
To be sure that the correct libraries are loaded you can rename the folder that contains the release version of libraries (the "win32/Bin" and "win32/Lib" folders).  

c. Debugging:
- Launch NaroCad,
- File->Attach to process, attach the debugger to the NaroCad process,
- Open the source file from File->Open source file,
- Go to the method/line to be debugged and put a breakpoint there (F9),
If the debugger stops responding (*BUSY*) is written in the status bar, please wait until it finishes parsing the symbol files,
- Press F5 to resume the process and start the application,
- Use the application until it stops at a breakpoint,
- Debugging is made using the WinDbg features like line by line execution or Watch window.
To reduce the lookup time it is not recommended to have too many variables in the watch window. A speed improvement would be to use a local variable prefix "$!" before the local variable name.
