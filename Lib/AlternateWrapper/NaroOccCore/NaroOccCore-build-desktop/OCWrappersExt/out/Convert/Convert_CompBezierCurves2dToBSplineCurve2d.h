// Methods PUBLIC

//! Constructs a framework for converting a sequence of <br>
//! adjacent non-rational Bezier curves into a BSpline curve. <br>
//! Knots will be created on the computed BSpline curve at <br>
//! each junction point of two consecutive Bezier curves. The <br>
//! degree of continuity of the BSpline curve will be increased at <br>
//! the junction point of two consecutive Bezier curves if their <br>
//! tangent vectors at this point are parallel. AngularTolerance <br>
//! (given in radians, and defaulted to 1.0 e-4) will be used <br>
//! to check the parallelism of the two tangent vectors. <br>
//! Use the following functions: <br>
//! -   AddCurve to define in sequence the adjacent Bezier <br>
//!  curves to be converted, <br>
//! -   Perform to compute the data needed to build the BSpline curve, <br>
//! -   and the available consultation functions to access the <br>
//!  computed data. This data may be used to construct the BSpline curve. <br>
OCConvert_CompBezierCurves2dToBSplineCurve2d(Standard_Real AngularTolerance);

//! Adds the Bezier curve defined by the table of poles Poles, to <br>
//!  the sequence (still contained in this framework) of adjacent <br>
//! Bezier curves to be converted into a BSpline curve. <br>
//! Only polynomial (i.e. non-rational) Bezier curves are <br>
//! converted using this framework. <br>
//! If this is not the first call to the function (i.e. if this framework <br>
//! still contains data in its sequence of Bezier curves), the <br>
//! degree of continuity of the BSpline curve will be increased at <br>
//! the time of computation at the first point of the added Bezier <br>
//! curve (i.e. the first point of the Poles table). This will be the <br>
//! case if the tangent vector of the curve at this point is <br>
//! parallel to the tangent vector at the end point of the <br>
//! preceding Bezier curve in the sequence of Bezier curves still <br>
//! contained in this framework. An angular tolerance given at <br>
//! the time of construction of this framework, will be used to <br>
//! check the parallelism of the two tangent vectors. This <br>
//! checking procedure, and all the relative computations will be <br>
//! performed by the function Perform. <br>
//! When the sequence of adjacent Bezier curves is complete, <br>
//! use the following functions: <br>
//! -   Perform to compute the data needed to build the BSpline curve, <br>
//! -   and the available consultation functions to access the <br>
//!  computed data. This data may be used to construct the BSpline curve. <br>
//!  Warning <br>
//! The sequence of Bezier curves treated by this framework is <br>
//! automatically initialized with the first Bezier curve when the <br>
//! function is first called. During subsequent use of this function, <br>
//! ensure that the first point of the added Bezier curve (i.e. the <br>
//! first point of the Poles table) is coincident with the last point <br>
//! of the sequence (i.e. the last point of the preceding Bezier <br>
//! curve in the sequence) of Bezier curves still contained in <br>
//! this framework. An error may occur at the time of <br>
//! computation if this condition is not satisfied. Particular care <br>
//! must be taken with respect to the above, as this condition is <br>
//! not checked either when defining the sequence of Bezier <br>
//! curves or at the time of computation. <br>
