//! A  Tool    to  glue faces  at  common    edges and <br>
//!          reconstruct shells. <br>
//! <br>
//!          The user designate pairs of common edges using the <br>
//!          method Bind. One edge is designated as the edge to <br>
//!          use  in place of the  other one (they are supposed <br>
//!          to   be    geometrically confused,  but  this  not <br>
//!          checked). They can be of opposite directions, this <br>
//!          is specified by the orientations. <br>
//! <br>
//!          The user can add  shapes with the Add method,  all <br>
//!          the faces are  registred and  copies of faces  and <br>
//!          edges are made to glue at the bound edges. <br>
//! <br>
//!          The user can call the Shells  methods to compute a <br>
//!          compound of shells from the current set of faces. <br>
//! <br>
//!          If no  binding is made  this class can  be used to <br>
//!          make shell from faces already sharing their edges. <br>
