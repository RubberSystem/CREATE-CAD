//! Describes a rational or non-rational Bezier curve <br>
//! - a non-rational Bezier curve is defined by a table of <br>
//!   poles (also called control points), <br>
//! - a rational Bezier curve is defined by a table of <br>
//!   poles with varying weights. <br>
//!  These data are manipulated by two parallel arrays: <br>
//! - the poles table, which is an array of gp_Pnt points, and <br>
//! - the weights table, which is an array of reals. <br>
//! The bounds of these arrays are 1 and "the number of "poles" of the curve. <br>
//! The poles of the curve are "control points" used to deform the curve. <br>
//! The first pole is the start point of the curve, and the <br>
//! last pole is the end point of the curve. The segment <br>
//! that joins the first pole to the second pole is the <br>
//! tangent to the curve at its start point, and the <br>
//! segment that joins the last pole to the <br>
//! second-from-last pole is the tangent to the curve at its end point. <br>
//! It is more difficult to give a geometric signification to <br>
//! the weights but they are useful for providing the exact <br>
//! representations of arcs of a circle or ellipse. <br>
//! Moreover, if the weights of all poles are equal, the <br>
//! curve is polynomial; it is therefore a non-rational <br>
//! curve. The non-rational curve is a special and <br>
//! frequently used case. The weights are defined and <br>
//! used only in the case of a rational curve. <br>
//! The degree of a Bezier curve is equal to the number <br>
//! of poles, minus 1. It must be greater than or equal to <br>
//! 1. However, the degree of a Geom_BezierCurve <br>
//! curve is limited to a value (25) which is defined and <br>
//! controlled by the system. This value is returned by the function MaxDegree. <br>
//! The parameter range for a Bezier curve is [ 0, 1 ]. <br>
//! If the first and last control points of the Bezier curve <br>
//! are the same point then the curve is closed. For <br>
//! example, to create a closed Bezier curve with four <br>
//! control points, you have to give the set of control <br>
//! points P1, P2, P3 and P1. <br>
//! The continuity of a Bezier curve is infinite. <br>
//! It is not possible to build a Bezier curve with negative <br>
//! weights. We consider that a weight value is zero if it <br>
//! is less than or equal to gp::Resolution(). We <br>
//! also consider that two weight values W1 and W2 are equal if: <br>
//! |W2 - W1| <= gp::Resolution(). <br>
//!   Warning <br>
//! - When considering the continuity of a closed Bezier <br>
//!   curve at the junction point, remember that a curve <br>
//!   of this type is never periodic. This means that the <br>
//!   derivatives for the parameter u = 0 have no <br>
//!   reason to be the same as the derivatives for the <br>
//!   parameter u = 1 even if the curve is closed. <br>
//! - The length of a Bezier curve can be null. <br>
