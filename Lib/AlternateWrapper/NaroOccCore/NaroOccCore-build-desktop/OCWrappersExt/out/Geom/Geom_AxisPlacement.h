//! The abstract class AxisPlacement describes the <br>
//! common behavior of positioning systems in 3D space, <br>
//! such as axis or coordinate systems. <br>
//! The Geom package provides two implementations of <br>
//! 3D positioning systems: <br>
//! - the axis (Geom_Axis1Placement class), which is defined by: <br>
//!   - its origin, also termed the "Location point" of the  axis, <br>
//!   - its unit vector, termed the "Direction" or "main <br>
//!    Direction" of the axis; <br>
//! - the right-handed coordinate system <br>
//!   (Geom_Axis2Placement class), which is defined by: <br>
//! - its origin, also termed the "Location point" of the coordinate system, <br>
//! - three orthogonal unit vectors, termed <br>
//!    respectively the "X Direction", the "Y Direction" <br>
//!    and the "Direction" of the coordinate system. As <br>
//!    the coordinate system is right-handed, these <br>
//!    unit vectors have the following relation: <br>
//!    "Direction" = "X Direction" ^ <br>
//!    "Y Direction". The "Direction" is also <br>
//!    called the "main Direction" because, when the <br>
//!    unit vector is modified, the "X Direction" and "Y <br>
//!    Direction" are recomputed, whereas when the "X <br>
//!    Direction" or "Y Direction" is modified, the "main Direction" does not change. <br>
//!     The axis whose origin is the origin of the positioning <br>
//! system and whose unit vector is its "main Direction" is <br>
//! also called the "Axis" or "main Axis" of the positioning system. <br>
