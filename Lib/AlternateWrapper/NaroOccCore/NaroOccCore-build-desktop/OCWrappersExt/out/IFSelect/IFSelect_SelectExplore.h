//! A SelectExplore determines from an input list of Entities, <br>
//!           a list obtained by a way of exploration. This implies the <br>
//!           possibility of recursive exploration : the output list is <br>
//!           itself reused as input, etc... <br>
//!           Examples : Shared Entities, can be considered at one level <br>
//!           (immediate shared) or more, or max level <br>
//! <br>
//!           Then, for each input entity, if it is not rejected, it can be <br>
//!           either taken itself, or explored : it then produces a list. <br>
//!           According to a level, either the produced lists or taken <br>
//!           entities give the result (level one), or lists are themselves <br>
//!           considered and for each item, is it taken or explored. <br>
//! <br>
//!           Remark that rejection is just a safety : normally, an input <br>
//!             entity is, either taken itself, or explored <br>
//!           A maximum level can be specified. Else, the process continues <br>
//!           until all entities have been either taken or rejected <br>
