//! This class performs the Copy operations involved by the <br>
//!           description of a ShareOut (evaluated by a ShareOutResult) <br>
//!           plus, if there are, the Modifications on the results, with <br>
//!           the help of Modifiers. Each Modifier can work on one or more <br>
//!           resulting packets, accoding its criteria : it operates on a <br>
//!           Model once copied and filled with the content of the packet. <br>
//! <br>
//!           Modifiers can be : <br>
//!           - Model Modifiers, inheriting from the specific class Modifier <br>
//!             able to run on the content of a Model (header or entities), <br>
//!             activated by the ModelCopier itself <br>
//!           - File Modifiers, inheriting directly from GeneralModifier, <br>
//!             intended to be activated under the control of a WorkLibrary, <br>
//!             once the Model has been produced (i.e. to act on output <br>
//!             format, or other specific file features) <br>
//! <br>
//!           The Copy operations can be : <br>
//!           - immediately put to files : for each packet, a Model is <br>
//!             created and filled, then the file is output, at that's all <br>
//!           - memorized : for each packet, a Model is created and filled, <br>
//!             it is memorized with the corresponding file name. <br>
//!             it is possible to query the result of memorization (list of <br>
//!             produced Models and their file names) <br>
//!             -> it is also possible to send it into the files : <br>
//!                once files are written, the result is cleared <br>
//! <br>
//!           In addition, a list of really written files is managed : <br>
//!           A first call to BeginSentFiles clears the list and commands, <br>
//!           either to begin a new list, or to stop recording it. A call <br>
//!           to SentFiles returns the list (if recording has been required) <br>
//!           This list allows to globally exploit the set of produced files <br>
//! <br>
//!           Remark : For operations which concern specific Entities, see <br>
//!           also in package IFAdapt : a sub-class of ModelCopier allows <br>
//!           to work with EntityModifier, in addition to Modifier itself <br>
//!           which still applies to a whole copied Model. <br>
