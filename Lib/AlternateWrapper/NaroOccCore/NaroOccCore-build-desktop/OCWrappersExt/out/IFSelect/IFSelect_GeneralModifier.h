//! This class gives a frame for Actions which modify the effect <br>
//!           of a Dispatch, i.e. : <br>
//!           By Selections and Dispatches, an original Model can be <br>
//!           splitted into one or more "target" Models : these Models <br>
//!           contain Entities copied from the original one (that is, a <br>
//!           part of it). Basically, these dispatched Entities are copied <br>
//!           as identical to their original counterparts. Also the copied <br>
//!           Models reproduce the Header of the original one. <br>
//! <br>
//!           Modifiers allow to change this copied content : this is the <br>
//!           way to be used for any kind of alterations, adaptations ... <br>
//!           They are exploited by a ModelCopier, which firstly performs <br>
//!           the copy operation described by Dispatches, then invokes the <br>
//!           Modifiers to work on the result. <br>
//! <br>
//!           Each GeneralModifier can be attached to : <br>
//!           - all the Models produced <br>
//!           - a Dispatch (it will be applied to all the Models obtained <br>
//!             from this Dispatch) designated by its Ident in a ShareOut <br>
//!           - in addition, to a Selection (facultative) : this adds a <br>
//!             criterium, the Modifier is invoked on a produced Model only <br>
//!             if this Model contains an Entity copied from one of the <br>
//!             Entities designated by this Selection. <br>
//!             (for special Modifiers from IFAdapt, while they must work on <br>
//!             definite Entities, this Selection is mandatory to run) <br>
//! <br>
//!             Remark : this class has no action attached, it only provides <br>
//!             a frame to work on criteria. Then, sub-classes will define <br>
//!             their kind of action, which can be applied at a precise step <br>
//!             of the production of a File : see Modifier, and in the <br>
//!             package IFAdapt, EntityModifier and EntityCopier <br>
