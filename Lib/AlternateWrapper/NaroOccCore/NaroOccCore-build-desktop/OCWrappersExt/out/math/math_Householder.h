//! This class implements the least square solution of a set of <br>

//!          This algorithm has more numerical stability than <br>
//!          GaussLeastSquare but is longer. <br>
//!          It must be used if the matrix is singular or nearly singular. <br>
//!          It is about 16% longer than GaussLeastSquare if there is only <br>
//!          one member B to solve. <br>
//!          It is about 30% longer if there are twenty B members to solve. <br>
