//! Taper-adding transformations on a shape. <br>
//! The resulting shape is constructed by defining one face <br>
//! to be tapered after another one, as well as the <br>
//! geometric properties of their tapered transformation. <br>
//! Each tapered transformation is propagated along the <br>
//! series of faces which are tangential to one another and <br>
//! which contains the face to be tapered. <br>
//! This algorithm is useful in the construction of molds or <br>
//! dies. It facilitates the removal of the article being produced. <br>
//! A DraftAngle object provides a framework for: <br>
//! - initializing the construction algorithm with a given shape, <br>
//! - acquiring the data characterizing the faces to be tapered, <br>
//! - implementing the construction algorithm, and <br>
//! - consulting the results. <br>
//! Warning <br>
//! - This algorithm treats planar, cylindrical and conical faces. <br>
//! - Do not use shapes, which with a draft angle added to <br>
//!   a face would modify the topology. This would, for <br>
//!   example, involve creation of new vertices, edges or <br>
//!   faces, or suppression of existing vertices, edges or faces. <br>
//! - Any face, which is continuous in tangency with the <br>
//!   face to be tapered, will also be tapered. These <br>
//!   connected faces must also respect the above criteria. <br>

//!  Adds the face F, the direction <br>
//! Direction, the angle Angle, the plane NeutralPlane, and the flag <br>
//! Flag to the framework created at construction time, and with this <br>
//! data, defines the taper-adding transformation. <br>
//! F is a face, which belongs to the initial shape of this algorithm or <br>
//! to the shape loaded by the function Init. <br>
//! Only planar, cylindrical or conical faces can be tapered: <br>
//! - If the face F is planar, it is tapered by inclining it <br>
//!   through the angle Angle about the line of intersection between the <br>
//!   plane NeutralPlane and F. <br>
//!   Direction indicates the side of NeutralPlane from which matter is <br>
//!   removed if Angle is positive or added if Angle is negative. <br>
//! - If F is cylindrical or conical, it is transformed in the <br>
//!   same way on a single face, resulting in a conical face if F <br>
//! is cylindrical, and a conical or cylindrical face if it is already conical. <br>
//! The taper-adding transformation is propagated from the face F along <br>
//! the series of planar, cylindrical or conical faces containing F, <br>
//! which are tangential to one another. <br>
//! Use the function AddDone to check if this taper-adding transformation is successful. <br>

//! - the face F does not belong to the initial shape of this algorithm, or <br>
