//! Describes functions to build evolved shapes. <br>
//! An evolved shape is built from a planar spine (face or <br>
//! wire) and a profile (wire). The evolved shape is the <br>
//! unlooped sweep (pipe) of the profile along the spine. <br>
//! Self-intersections are removed. <br>
//! A MakeEvolved object provides a framework for: <br>
//! - defining the construction of an evolved shape, <br>
//! - implementing the construction algorithm, and <br>
//! - consulting the result. <br>
//!        Computes an Evolved by <br>
//!             1 - sweeping a profil along a spine. <br>
//!             2 - removing the self-intersections. <br>
//! <br>
//!  The profile is defined in a Referential R. The position of <br>
//!  the profile at the current point of the  spine is given by <br>
//!  confusing R  and the local  referential given by (  D0, D1 <br>
//!  and the normal of the Spine) <br>
//! <br>
//!  If the Boolean <AxeProf> is  true, R is  O,X,Y,Z <br>
//!  else R is defined as the local refential at the nearest <br>
//!  point of the profil to the spine. <br>
//! <br>
//!   if <Solid> is TRUE the Shape result  is completed to be a <br>
//!   solid or a compound of solids. <br>

//! These constructors construct an evolved shape by sweeping the profile <br>
//! Profile along the spine Spine. <br>
//!	The profile is defined in a coordinate system R. <br>
//! The coordinate system is determined by AxeProf: <br>
//! - if AxeProf is true, R is the global coordinate system, <br>
//! - if AxeProf is false, R is computed so that: <br>
//!   - its origin is given by the point on the spine which is <br>
//!    closest to the profile, <br>
//!   - its "X Axis" is given by the tangent to the spine at this point, and <br>
//! - its "Z Axis" is the normal to the plane which contains the spine. <br>
//!        The position of the profile at the current point of the <br>
//! spine is given by making R coincident with the local <br>
//! coordinate system given by the current point, the <br>
//! tangent vector and the normal to the spine. <br>
//! Join defines the type of pipe generated by the salient <br>
//! vertices of the spine. The default type is GeomAbs_Arc <br>
//! where the vertices generate revolved pipes about the <br>
//! axis passing along the vertex and the normal to the <br>
//! plane of the spine. At present, this is the only <br>
//! construction type implemented. <br>
