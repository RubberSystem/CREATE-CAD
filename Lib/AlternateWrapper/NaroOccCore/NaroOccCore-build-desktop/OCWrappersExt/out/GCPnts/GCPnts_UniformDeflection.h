//! Note: This algorithm is relatively time consuming. A <br>
//! GCPnts_QuasiUniformDeflection algorithm is <br>
//! quicker; it can also work with non-'C2' continuous <br>
//! curves, but it generates more points in the distribution. <br>

//! This and the above methods initialize (or reinitialize) this algorithm and <br>

//! -   on the curve C, or <br>
//! -   on the part of curve C limited by the two <br>
//!   parameter values U1 and U2, <br>
//! where the maximum distance between C and the <br>
//! polygon that results from the points of the <br>
//! distribution is not greater than Deflection. <br>
//! The first point of the distribution is either the origin <br>
//! of curve C or the point of parameter U1. The last <br>
//! point of the distribution is either the end point of <br>
//! curve C or the point of parameter U2. Intermediate <br>
//! points of the distribution are built using <br>
//! interpolations of segments of the curve limited at <br>
//! the 2nd degree. The construction ensures, in a first <br>
//! step, that the chordal deviation for this <br>
//! interpolation of the curve is less than or equal to <br>
//! Deflection. However, it does not ensure that the <br>
//! chordal deviation for the curve itself is less than or <br>
//! equal to Deflection. To do this a check is <br>
//! necessary, which may generate (second step) <br>
//! additional intermediate points. This check is time <br>
//! consuming, and can be avoided by setting <br>
