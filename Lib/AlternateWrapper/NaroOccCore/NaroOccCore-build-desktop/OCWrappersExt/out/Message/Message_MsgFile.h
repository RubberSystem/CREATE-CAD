//! A tool providing facility to load definitions of message strings from <br>
//!          resource file(s). <br>
//! <br>
//!          The message file is an ASCII file which defines a set of messages. <br>
//!          Each message is identified by its keyword (string). <br>
//! <br>
//!          All lines in the file starting with the exclamation sign <br>
//!          (perhaps preceeding by spaces and/or tabs) are ignored as comments. <br>
//! <br>
//!          Each line in the file starting with the dot character "." <br>
//!          (perhaps preceeding by spaces and/or tabs) defines the keyword. <br>
//!          The keyword is a string starting from the next symbol after dot <br>
//!          and ending at the symbol preceeding ending newline character "\n". <br>
//! <br>
//!          All the lines in the file after the keyword and before next <br>
//!          keyword (and which are not comments) define the message for that <br>
//!          keyword. If the message consists of several lines, the message <br>
//!          string will contain newline symbols "\n" between parts (but not <br>
//!          at the end). <br>
//! <br>
//!          The experimental support of Unicode message files is provided. <br>
//!          These are distinguished by two bytes FF.FE or FE.FF at the beginning. <br>
//! <br>
//!          The loaded messages are stored in static data map; all methods of that <br>
//!          class are also static. <br>

//! Loads the messages from the file with name (without extension) <br>
//!          given by environment variable. <br>
//!          Extension of the file name is given separately. If its not <br>
//!          defined, it is taken: <br>

//! Adds new message to the map. Parameter <key> gives <br>
//!          the key of the message, <text> defines the message itself. <br>

//! Gives the text for the message identified by the keyword <key> <br>
//!          If there are no messages with such keyword defined, <br>
//!          the error message is returned. <br>
//!          In that case reference to static string is returned, it can <br>
//!          be chenged with next call(s) to Msg(). <br>
//!          Note: The error message is constructed like 'Unknown message: <key>', and can <br>
//!                itself be customized by defining message with key Message_Msg_BadKeyword. <br>
